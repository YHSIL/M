  <h2>Early political career</h2>
In the 1950 and 1951 general elections, Roberts was the Conservative candidate for the safe Labour seat of Dartford. The local party selected her as its candidate because, though not a dynamic public speaker, Roberts was well-prepared and fearless in her answers; prospective candidate Bill Deedes recalled that "Once she opened her mouth, the rest of us began to look rather second-rate".[18] She attracted media attention as the youngest and the only female candidate.[36] She lost on both occasions to Norman Dodds, but reduced the Labour majority by 6,000, and then a further 1,000.[37] During the campaigns, she was supported by her parents and by future husband Denis Thatcher, whom she married in December 1951.[37][38] Denis funded his wife's studies for the bar;[39] she qualified as a barrister in 1953 and specialised in taxation.[40] Later that same year their twins Carol and Mark were born, delivered prematurely by Caesarean section.[41]
