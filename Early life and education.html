  <h2>Early life and education</h2>
Margaret Hilda Roberts was born on 13 October 1925, in Grantham, Lincolnshire.[2] Her parents were Alfred Roberts (1892–1970), from Northamptonshire, and Beatrice Ethel (née Stephenson, 1888–1960), from Lincolnshire.[2][3] She spent her childhood in Grantham, where her father owned two grocery shops. In 1938, prior to the Second World War, the Roberts family briefly gave sanctuary to a teenage Jewish girl who had escaped Nazi Germany.[4] Margaret and her pen-friending sister Muriel saved pocket money to help pay for the teenager's journey.<br>
Alfred Roberts was an alderman and a Methodist local preacher,[7] and brought up his daughter as a strict Wesleyan Methodist,[8] attending the Finkin Street Methodist Church.[9] He came from a Liberal family but stood (as was then customary in local government) as an Independent. He served as Mayor of Grantham from 1945–46 and lost his position as alderman in 1952 after the Labour Party won its first majority on Grantham Council in 1950.[7]<br>
